    W.M. McKeeman:
    It is as important to forbid non-sense
    as it is to permit good sense.
    D. Gries:
    The importance of style in the language
    cannot be overestimated.
    L. Reiners:
    Denken und Ausdruck sind aufs innigste verkettet.
    Wer seinen Stil verbessert, schult auch sein Denken.

SPTS is (whatever you prefer) :

          Structured Programming Tool Set
          System Programmer's Tool Set
          Sylvester Peter's Toy Set

   It has three functional components :

     1: SPTS MACLIB

        The core functionality are assembler macros for structured
        programming:

        - a large set of control flow statements
        - statement like conditional expressions
        - composition of expressions ($EX EX$ ORELSE, ANDTHEN)
        - basic comparison expressions ($EXPR$ and TRUECC)
        - assignment statements (LET)
        - Organisation of code and static data using LTORG

        Usage requires at least the SLAC version of ASMH.

        The macros can be used without the other tools.

     2 SPTS PCPARSER

        A tool to work on structured pseudo code version
        of some software/program. PCPARSER transforms the
        pseudo code into an assembler skeleton and produces
        a documentation. The assembler skeleton is provided
        as IEBUPDTE input (program refinements are translated
        into COPYLIB members.
        PCPARSER is written in STRUBOL, an enhanced version
        of SPITBOL. Source is included for inspiration.

        The pseudo code combines
        - a set of control flow statements
          translated into corresponding macros
        - free form text as pseudo code
          translated to comments (actually @ macro)

     3: SPTS SASLIST

        A program acting on the assembler listing (SLAC version)
        to enhance readability. Using is not required.
